#LAB :Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Deployment Manager and Cloud Monitoring

## OBJECTIVES:
In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

Create a Deployment Manager deployment.
Update a Deployment Manager deployment.
View the load on a VM instance using Cloud Monitoring.

#STEPS:
1.Confirm that needed APIs are enabled
#Make a note of the name of your GCP project.

gcloud projects list

#Using the applicable project ID from the previous step, set the default project to the one in which you want to enable the API

gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID

#Scroll down in the list of enabled APIs, and confirm that these APIs are enabled:

gcloud services list --available

#If one or more APIs is missing, click the Enable APIs and Services 

gcloud services enable SERVICE_NAME

2.Create agcloud projects list Deployment Manager deployment


#place the zone that Qwiklabs assigned you to into an environment variable called MY_ZONE

export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a

#download an editable Deployment Manager template

gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/gcpfcoreinfra/mydeploy.yaml mydeploy.yaml

#replace the PROJECT_ID placeholder string with your Google Cloud Platform project ID 

sed -i -e "s/PROJECT_ID/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/" mydeploy.yaml

#View the mydeploy.yaml file

cat mydeploy.yaml

Build a deployment from the template

gcloud deployment-manager deployments create my-first-depl --config mydeploy.yaml

=Confirm that the deployment was successful


3. Update a Deployment Manager deployment

#Launch the nano text editor to edit the mydeploy.yaml file:

nano mydeploy.yaml

Find the line that sets the value of the startup script, value: "apt-get update",

4. View the Load on a VM using Cloud Monitoring

5.

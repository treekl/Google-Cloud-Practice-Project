#LAB:Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

##OBJECTIVES:In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

Initialize App Engine.
Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.
Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

##Activate Google Cloud Shell
#list the active account name

gcloud auth list
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
#Output:Credentialed accounts: 
- <myaccount>@<mydomain>.com (active)

#Example Output Credentialed accounts:
- google1623327_student@qwiklabs.net

# list the project ID
gcloud config list project

##STEP 1: Initialize App Engine
Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:

#gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:

git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

#Navigate to the source directory:

cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

##STEP 2: Run Hello World application locally

#Execute the following command to download and update the packages list

sudo apt-get update

#Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application.

sudo apt-get install virtualenv

#If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter.

virtualenv -p python3 venv

#Activate the virtual environment.

source venv/bin/activate

#Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.

pip install  -r requirements.txt

#Run the application:

python main.py

STEP 3: Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine

#Navigate to the source directory:

cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

#Deploy your Hello World application.

gcloud app deploy

#STEP 4 Disable the application

gcloud services disable [APPid] appengine
